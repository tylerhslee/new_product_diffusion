The modules have been tested on Python 3.5.2.
They collect all weekly sales data for all regions on vgchartz.com.

==============================================================================

Instructions

Please install all the modules listed in requirements.txt. You can do so
with a following command in the terminal:

    pip intall -r requirements.txt

If the default Python version is NOT 3.x on your machine, you may want to use
pip3 instead of pip.

If you get any ImportError while running the modules, you may want to install
the following modules manually (They are all installabe via pip):

    BeautifulSoup
    pandas
    requests

Once you have set up the working environment, please run main.py. All output
files will be located in release/data. I have included a sample data of USA 
as a reference.
